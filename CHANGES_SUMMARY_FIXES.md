# Debug and Fix Summary - Main Branch

## Date
October 18, 2025

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Makefile - Syntax Errors in Echo Macros ✅
**Issue:** The helper macros (echoblue, echogreen, etc.) were using `echo -e` which wasn't supported by the shell, causing "-e" to appear in output.

**Fix:** Changed all macros to use `printf` instead of `echo -e`:
- Updated macro definitions to use `@printf "$(COLOR)%s$(NC)\n" "$(1)"`
- Removed all nested quotes in macro calls throughout the Makefile (70+ instances)
- Fixed backtick command substitution issue in help target

**Files Modified:** `Makefile`

### 2. lapverse-core/package.json - Merge Conflict ✅
**Issue:** Unresolved git merge conflict with duplicate dependencies and branch markers at lines 43 and 49.

**Conflicts:**
- Duplicate entries for: axios, dotenv, supertest, zod
- Merge markers: "main" and "cursor/the-lap-verse-core-service-polish-ae35"

**Fix:** Resolved conflict by:
- Keeping the most appropriate versions of dependencies
- Removing duplicate entries
- Removing merge conflict markers

**Files Modified:** `lapverse-core/package.json`

### 3. scripts/install-kimi.sh - Merge Conflict ✅
**Issue:** Two different versions of the installation script merged together with conflict markers.

**Fix:** Kept the more complete, production-ready version with:
- Color-coded output
- Docker and Docker Compose checks
- Network creation
- Helper scripts (kimi-cli, check-kimi)
- Removed merge conflict markers

**Files Modified:** `scripts/install-kimi.sh`

**Fix:** Kept the more detailed guide with:
- Prerequisites section
- Step-by-step installation
