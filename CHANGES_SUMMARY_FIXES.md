# Debug and Fix Summary - Main Branch

## Date
October 18, 2025

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Makefile - Syntax Errors in Echo Macros âœ…
**Issue:** The helper macros (echoblue, echogreen, etc.) were using `echo -e` which wasn't supported by the shell, causing "-e" to appear in output.

**Fix:** Changed all macros to use `printf` instead of `echo -e`:
- Updated macro definitions to use `@printf "$(COLOR)%s$(NC)\n" "$(1)"`
- Removed all nested quotes in macro calls throughout the Makefile (70+ instances)
- Fixed backtick command substitution issue in help target

**Files Modified:** `Makefile`

**Conflicts:**
- Duplicate entries for: axios, dotenv, supertest, zod
- Merge markers: "main" and "cursor/the-lap-verse-core-service-polish-ae35"

**Fix:** Resolved conflict by:
- Keeping the most appropriate versions of dependencies
