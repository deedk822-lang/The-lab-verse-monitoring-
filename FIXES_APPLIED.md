## Integration with Existing Stack

The fixes integrate seamlessly with the existing Lab Verse monitoring infrastructure:

- **Kimi AI Manager** (Port 8084) - AI orchestration service
- **LapVerse Core** (Port 3000) - Main application service  
- **Grafana Dashboard** (Port 3001) - Monitoring visualization
- **Prometheus** (Port 9090) - Metrics collection
- **AlertManager** (Port 9093) - Alert management

All validation scripts account for this architecture and verify service health accordingly.

## Support and Maintenance

For ongoing support:

1. **Check CI Status** - Monitor GitHub Actions for build failures
2. **Review Health Checks** - Run daily health validation
3. **Monitor Resources** - Use Grafana dashboards for system monitoring
4. **Security Updates** - Regular dependency updates and security scans

**Contact:** Repository maintainers and DevOps team  
**Documentation:** README.md, QUICKSTART.md, and service-specific docs
