## 🚨 If Something Fails

Manus should:

2. Verify prerequisites are installed
3. Confirm Vercel deployment is live:
   ```bash
   curl https://snout-lard-jumbo-5158.vercel.app/api/inngest
   ```
4. Test MCP servers individually before combining

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check Windsurf is running
pgrep -f windsurf

# View logs
tail -f /tmp/windsurf.log

# Test Vercel endpoint
curl -X POST https://snout-lard-jumbo-5158.vercel.app/api/inngest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event":"test","data":{"title":"Test"}}'

# Verify Docker
docker ps
docker images | grep github-mcp-server

# Check npm global packages
npm list -g --depth=0 | grep http-mcp-server
```
